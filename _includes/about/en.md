Hey, I’m **0x5t** – an ethical hacker and web exploitation specialist with a deep focus on vulnerability research, penetration testing, and Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. I specialize in discovering and exploiting web-based vulnerabilities, continuously refining my skill set in areas like **SQL Injection, XSS, SSRF, HTTP Request Smuggling, Prototype Pollution, and API Exploitation**.

### Cybersecurity & CTFs
I actively engage in CTF competitions, solving complex challenges that push the limits of offensive security techniques. My expertise spans across web security, cryptography, and advanced exploitation methodologies. I am a part of **[RaptX](https://ctftime.org/team/357584)**, a globally ranked CTF team, where I collaborate with like-minded professionals to tackle some of the most challenging cybersecurity problems.

You can track my progress and achievements on:
- **[HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1804529)** – Practicing real-world pentesting scenarios.
- **[CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/team/357584)** – Contributing to high-level CTF competitions with my team.

### Technical Skillset
My work revolves around **offensive security**, focusing on:
- **Web Application Security** – Exploiting modern web vulnerabilities using manual and automated techniques.
- **Burp Suite & API Testing** – Deep-dive security assessments for web services and API endpoints.
- **Custom Payload Crafting** – Bypassing WAFs, firewalls, and implementing evasive attack techniques.
- **Recon & Enumeration** – OSINT, subdomain enumeration, and advanced fingerprinting for target discovery.

### Ethical Hacking & Learning
Beyond CTFs, I dedicate my time to **practical security research**, continuously testing new attack vectors, reverse engineering security implementations, and documenting vulnerabilities to improve web security awareness. My goal is to **push the boundaries of what's possible in ethical hacking**, and I share my findings through **detailed write-ups, live demonstrations, and community discussions**.

Hey, I'm 0x5t – an ethical hacker and web exploitation specialist with a passion for CTFs and modern vulnerability research. I focus on uncovering innovative attack vectors and continuously refining my skills in areas like SQL injection, XSS, SSRF, and API exploitation.

I enjoy sharing my experiences and insights to help others navigate the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. Whether it's through live demonstrations, detailed write-ups, or collaborative problem-solving, my goal is to push the boundaries of what’s possible in ethical hacking and secure software development.
